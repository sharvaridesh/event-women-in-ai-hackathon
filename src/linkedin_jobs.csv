Our groundbreaking discoveries in basic and clinical research are transforming medicine. We share a singular commitment to advancing science for the benefit of humanity. Our collaborative culture drives each of us to achieve a higher level, fueling the breakthroughs for which we are known. 
Many of our most sophisticated cognitive abilities are thought to have evolved to subserve social interactions, yet the underlying computations that make these interactions possible, in all their complexity and nuance, remain elusive. The Price Family Center for the Social Brain (PFCSB) at The Rockefeller University was therefore established to map the molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms of social behavior and to use these insights to forge new links between basic and applied neuroscience, with the ultimate goal to alleviate impairments of social brain function. Central to the PFCSB's ambitious goal is to leverage and build on recent advances in AI-based Computer Vision technologies to characterize the detailed behavioral dynamics of interacting pairs and populations of animals. The Data Science Resource Center (DSRC) at The Rockefeller University will work in close collaboration with Price Center scientists to advance these research objectives with the development of novel machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) algorithms that can shed light on the fundamental building blocks of social behaviors.

About PRN Healthcare

Our story starts with a 21-year-old CNA named Pete Hietpas. Pete was diligently working in eastern Wisconsin with a variety of staffing agencies, but something was missing. He loved caring for his patients, but felt that staffing agencies were exchanging compassion for competitiveness. He was determined to change that. As a result, he started Nurses PRN in 1995 to become a model for the healthcare staffing industry – being competitive in the marketplace, yet still maintaining a compassionate heart.

Over the years Nurses PRN grew and evolved as a nationwide healthcare staffing company, and therefore wanted to be more inclusive to all valued healthcare professionals: nurses, allied health, locum tenens, CNAs, and more. This lead to the introduction of PRN Healthcare, which is inclusive of Nurses PRN and all of our other healthcare divisions.

Our mission to create authentic, meaningful relationships with our healthcare professionals helps us set them up for success in their dream assignment, whether that be a travel contract, local contract, or per diem shift. This is all driven by the simple idea that better care for our healthcare workers, leads to better patient care – and this is all supported by a dedicated internal staff.

Our company culture is strongly backed by faith-based values and activities, to remind us that our success provides us the opportunity to serve and give back to our communities. This is the spirit of caregiving.

Frequently Asked Questions

What does an Investment Analyst’s day-to-day look like?

Although our work is extremely varied, a hypothetical day might consist of the following:

After reviewing your emails and working on an investment memo, you and three other team members meet a prospective real estate manager targeting apartments and industrial properties across the Sunbelt region of the US. You ask questions about their “secret sauce” and overall market dynamics during the meeting and afterwards debrief with the other Foundation team members about the merits and considerations of the investment strategy. Afterwards, you prep for an Annual General Meeting that you will attend the following week for a private equity technology firm that the Foundation has invested with . You then meet with the public equity portfolio manager to discuss creating a new report that will be used monthly to better understand the types of risks that our underlying funds are taking. Finally, you finish your day with a meeting alongside other investment team members with an existing private credit manager that lends to fintech companies.

What does the Foundation’s professional development consist of?

Are you a team player who can implement behavior management strategies to improve the lives of others?

At Devereux as a Direct Support Professional you will have the opportunity to work with children ages 8-21 with IDD/BH/MH diagnoses and will impact the individuals you are working with by unlocking their full potential on a daily basis.

The Mapleton Intensive Program  serves biological females, ages 12 to 16 at the time of admission. The program is inclusive for all youth with respect to sexual orientation and gender identity. The focus of the Mapleton program is to create an environment which promotes strength, recovery and resilience by addressing a variety of complex emotional and behavioral challenges. Youth in this program have been challenged by a lack of intact family support or underdeveloped supportive kinship networks. The youth have frequently had multiple psychiatric hospitalizations and repeated contacts with mental health, child welfare and juvenile justice systems. The youth require intensive supports to help them maximize successes. The Mapleton Intensive Program is designed to meet the needs of these youth with staff and a clinical team who are skilled in the navigation of complex family situations and in working with youth and stakeholders to develop kinship networks.

From a behavioral perspective, the youth in this program have skill deficits in impulse control, emotion regulation and an inability to perform age-appropriate developmental skills secondary to either direct or vicarious traumatization. This traumatization has often compromised their resilience and resulted in feelings of emptiness, fear, abandonment, impulsivity, emotion dysregulation, and self-destructive behaviors. These traits lead to multiple life consequences such as challenges in school, family conflict, dependency or delinquent court involvement, absence of a healthy peer group, lack of vocational and life skills, and a history of unsuccessful placements.

3899527481,Big Shoulders Fund,"Director, Next Generation Boards","BIG SHOULDERS FUNDBig Shoulders Fund is an independent tax-exempt charitable organization that provides support to schools with demonstrated need which provide a quality, values-based education for children. We serve 25,000 students and 92 schools in the Chicago and Northwest Indiana regions. Each school is a vital community-based organization and an anchor to its surrounding neighborhoods.  For thirty-seven years, Big Shoulders Fund has helped Chicago’s children achieve their dreams through access to high quality education. Of the 25,000 students we serve, 83% identify as people of color and 69% reside in low-income households. We expand access and outcomes by investing more than $40 million annually in scholarship support and enrichment programming for students; operational improvements for schools; cultivation of talent pipelines for school personnel from new teachers through veteran principals; and professional development and support for educators and leaders – all with the goal of not just strengthening schools, but whole communities, while preparing students for life-long success. To that end, 80% of scholars matriculate to college and students earn a degree at two times the national average. Latino and Black scholars graduate at three-times and four-times their counterparts, respectively, and graduates go on to vote, contribute, and participate at greater rates than local and national outcomes.
In 2019, Big Shoulders Fund began an exciting new chapter in Northwest Indiana by making a long-term commitment to The Region. Since then, we have worked to bring our unique approach to building the capacity of local school communities to best serve students and families of Northwest Indiana, with special focus on areas of greatest need: Gary, Hammond and East Chicago. The long-term goals of our efforts include elevating the quality of values-based schools in Northwest Indiana through: academic investments, instructional and data coaching; marketing and outreach efforts; and enrichment and summer programs to expand opportunities for students. While some roles on our staff focus exclusively on Northwest Indiana, all Big Shoulders Fund team members contribute to the success of our work in The Region.

families; and second, to establish a “standard of care” across a variety of shelters and

housing programs. Working directly with the community, we help children and families

address the root traumas that helped shape their worldviews, explore healthier

perspectives, and learn practical non-violent skill sets for managing stress. We do this

through comprehensive mental health services, case management, family education

and support services, and community leadership.
